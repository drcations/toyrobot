ToyRobot::Program
  #initialize
    converts plaintext into a sequence commands
  #perform
    with a test program 1
      returns a correct world
    with a test program 2
      returns a correct world (FAILED - 1)
    with a test program 3
      returns a correct world (FAILED - 2)
    with a difficult program
      returns a correct world (FAILED - 3)
    when trying to escape east by north
      stays in the world (FAILED - 4)
    when trying to escape west by south
      stays in the world (FAILED - 5)
    without any placement
      returns an empty world
    with incorrect placement
      returns an empty world
